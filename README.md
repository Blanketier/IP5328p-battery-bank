# IP5328p-battery-bank
This is a small modular (meaning it can take any capacity 4.2v lion/lipo battery) 
I have made the version one board and gave it to a person to use for a two month test. The main issues were the inductor hits Isat under max load (18w) and drops into the audible range.
The version 1.1 board *should* fix this by using a much beefier inductor and it likely is overkill board version 1.2 will likely use a smaller inductor then v1.1 but will be larger than 1.0
This is a battery bank that has two type a outputs a type c combo in and out and an input only micro-b port on the side.
Soon I will upload a case that omits the cutout for the micro-b port since it is purely redundant.
The case is made for use with three 18650 Li-ion cells.
